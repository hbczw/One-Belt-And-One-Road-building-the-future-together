The economic corridor covers most of the economically underdeveloped areas of the four countries, but there are abundant resources. If the economic corridor can be developed to develop the region's railway, highway, communications and other infrastructure construction, will benefit the region and the whole of Asia's economic prosperity, but also conducive to the improvement of the living standards of people along the line.</p>

<p>The new Eurasian Continental Bridge is the shortest distance from the two major manufacturing centers connecting Asia and Europe, which is shorter than the Siberian Bridge by 2,000-5000 km from the Siberian Bridge. At the same time, the new Eurasian Continental Bridge also has a trade-driven advantage. Northeast Asia, Central Asia, Central and Northern Europe continue to promote the industrial division of labor for the new Eurasian Continental Bridge has brought a huge trade drive. Therefore, the new Asia-Europe Bridge will form a strategic economic corridor.</p>
<h3>（四）China - Russia Economic Corridor</h3>
<p>Sino-Mongolian economic corridor is divided into two lines: one from North China's Beijing-Hebei to Hohhot, and then to Mongolia and Russia; Second, the Northeast from Dalian, Shenyang, Changchun, Harbin to Manchuria and Russia Chita.
