With the implementation of the "The Belt and Road" strategy, some of China's quality surplus industries will be transferred to other countries and regions. In the country, because the market supply and demand changes, some surplus industries, perhaps in other countries can be just a reasonable valuation; in the country, because the factor costs rise in some industries, products lose the price competitiveness, perhaps in other countries, Low factor costs will make these industries reproduce. In the country, because the export of some developed countries affected the development of the entire industry, perhaps in other countries will be able to bypass these barriers, and so on. In addition, due to industrial transformation caused by industrial transformation and upgrading is an unlimited opportunity, such as technological transformation, R & D investment, brand tree, etc. will give investors unlimited opportunities.</p>

                              <p>China's reform and opening up is the largest innovation in the world today. With the development of economic corridor theory, economic belt theory and international cooperation theory in the 21st century, the theory of economic development, regional cooperation theory, globalization theory The "The Belt and Road" emphasizing the principle of sharing, building and sharing, beyond the Marshall Plan, foreign aid and going out strategy, to the 21st century international cooperation to bring new ideas.</p>
　　                          <p>For example, the concept of "economic belt" is the innovation of regional economic cooperation model, including economic corridor - Sino-Russian economic corridor, the new Eurasian Continental Bridge, China-Central Asia Economic Corridor, Bangladesh-India-Burma Economic Corridor, China- Corridors, etc., to the economic growth of radiation around, beyond the traditional development of economic theory.</p>

                              <p>Traditional globalization is made up of the sea, born by the sea, coastal areas, marine countries first developed, land-based countries, the Mainland is relatively backward, the formation of a huge gap between rich and poor. Traditional globalization is opened up by Europe, developed by the United States, the formation of the international order of the "Western Center", leading to the East subordinate to the West, rural subordinate to the city, land subordinate to the ocean and a series of unbalanced unreasonable effect. Today, "The Belt and Road" is driving global rebalancing. "The Belt and Road" to encourage the opening to the west, led the development of the western region and Central Asia, Mongolia and other landlocked countries and regions in the international community to implement the concept of inclusive development of globalization; at the same time, "The Belt and Road" China's high-quality production capacity and comparative advantages of the industry, will make along the coastal countries first benefit, but also changed the history of Central Asia and other Silk Road along the East and West trade and cultural exchanges as a corridor and become the development of "depression" face. This transcends the gap between the rich and the poor caused by the globalization created by the Europeans, the uneven development of the region, and the promotion of a harmonious world of lasting peace, universal security and common prosperity.</p>
